        this is a statically generated nextjs app running on an Azure Static Web
        App (or locally via npm run dev). we&apos;re using nextjs because
        there&apos;s a good chance we&apos;ll convert this to a hybrid app in
        the future and can simply add the new features and swap its deployment
        to something that handles server-side rendering.
